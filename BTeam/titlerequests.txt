Title - Custom Title Requests

You can use this page in order to request a custom title, please note [b]this is not for ranking up[/b].  Acquiring a rank requires 100 votes and changing an existing one requires 100 more votes than when you received your first title.

Please note that some rules apply to what titles are able to be, these are:
1 - Titles must be shorter than ten characters.
2 - All ranks will be [color=orange]orange[/color].
3 - No inappropriate names are allowed.
4 - Getting banned will remove your title, however you will be able to buy it back for 100 votes.

If your application fails to pass one of these rules, then your original post will show something like:

[size=14pt][color=red]Request Denied - Reason[/color][/size]

The application used should be designed as follows:

[code][b]IGN[/b]: 
[b]Total Votes[/b]: 
[b]Title Requested[/b]: 
[b]Is this a title change?[/b]: [/code]
